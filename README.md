# 📝Problem Statement
Global climate change refers to the rise of earth's temperature, caused by human factors. It originates from the greenhouse effect of certain gases in our atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) that block the escaping heat. The concentration of these gases has risen dramatically by human impact since the mid of the 20th century, with the burning of fossil fuels (oil and gas) and deforestation being main causes of this rise. The observed and expected effects include more and longer periods of draught, wildfires and an increased number of extreme weather events.

# ⏳ Dataset
Download the dataset for this project from following Link -

# 📚 Data Analysis
In the datasets, we are provided with 4 columns(Features) of data.


# 🖥️ Technologies:
## 🛠️ Tools Used
* Jupyter Notebook is used as IDE.
* Pandas and NumPy are used for Data Manipulation & Pre-processing and Mathematical functions respectively.
* For visualization of the plots, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly are used.
* Geopy and Folium libraies were used to perform Spatial Analysis.
* GitHub is used as version control system

# 🎉 Tasks performed under Spatial Analysis:
* Extract the **"Latitude"** and **"Longitude"** w.r.t. different Locations using Python's ***Geopy*** Library.
* Generated a **"BaseMap"** of Countries using Python's ***Folium*** Library.
* Plotted a HeatMap based of variety of Use Cases with the help of Python's ***Folium "HeatMap" Plugins.***
* Performed **"Marker Cluster Analysis"** on top of the **"HeatMap"** using Python's ***Folium "FastMarkerCluster" Plugins.***
